# TANMS-Research
This repository serves as a collection of some of the research work I conducted at the Center for Translational Applications of Nanoscale Multiferroic Systems (TANMS). Much of my work is generating simulations of nanoantennas.

# Applied Computational Electromagnetics Society (ACES) Journal Paper
I worked with my mentor Jesse Rivera on a paper for the May 2021 publication of the ACES journal. My roles involved the generation of some figures along with the discussion of ideas with my mentor. Once the paper is finalized, I will post a copy in the repository.
